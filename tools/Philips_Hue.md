## FAQs

#### Q: What is the Subconscious Effect of Colored Lighting?

A: 

* **RED** – The boldest of the colors, red has been known to not only have an impact on an individual’s appetite, it can also help to paint things in a more urgent light.
* **BLUE** – Calm and peaceful, blue has been used by many large companies for the sense of security it provides. Blue light has also been shown to increase productivity
* **PURPLE** – Purple’s effects are directed at the creative mind. Whether it’s solving complex logistical problems or deciding on the twist in your next chapter, this hue will help harness your creative energies.
* **GREEN** – Because this color is especially easy on the eyes (it really does cause the least amount of eye strain!), it’s ideal for creating harmony and peace.
* **ORANGE & YELLOW** – If there’s ever been a more joyful color than orange and yellow, we have yet to find it. These two hues are particularly great at adding a bit of optimism to your day.
