## What 

### Overview

When only the question is shown, Anki shows three numbers like 12 + 34 + 56 at the bottom of the screen. These represent 

* the **new** cards, 
* cards in **learning**, and 
* cards to **review**. 

If you’d prefer not to see the numbers, you can turn them off in Anki’s preferences.

In the **old** scheduler, the numbers count **reviews** needed to finish all the cards in that queue, not the **number** of cards. If you have multiple steps configured for lapsed cards, the number will increase by more than one when you **fail a card**, since that card needs to be shown **several times**.

In the **new** scheduler, the numbers count **cards**, so the number will always increase by one regardless of the **steps** remaining.

When the answer is shown, Anki shows an **estimate of the next time** a card will be **shown** above each button. If you’d prefer not to see the estimates, you can disable them in Anki’s preferences.

Anki additionally adds a small amount of **random variation** to the next due times, in order to prevent cards that were introduced together and always rated the same from always staying next to each other. This variation is **not shown on the time estimates** but will be applied after selecting the button.
