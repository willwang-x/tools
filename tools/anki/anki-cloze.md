# Anki Cloze

> ‘Cloze deletion’ is the process of hiding one or more words in a sentence. 


## Why

If you are a beginner and if you find it difficult to stick to the **minimum information principle**, use **cloze deletion**! If you are an advanced user, you will also like cloze deletion. It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can be subject to learning based on spaced repetition. **Cloze deletion** makes the core of the fast reading and learning technique called **incremental reading**.


## What

* **[Incremental reading](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Incremental_reading)**: Incremental reading is a **software-assisted** method for learning and retaining information from reading, which involves the creation of **flashcards** out of electronic articles. "Incremental reading" means "reading in **portions**".
* **[minimum information principle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Minimum_information_principle)**: Minimum information principle says that simple questions formulated for **active recall** in learning bring much **better memory outcomes** than complex questions even though one complex question may be equivalent to a large number of simpler questions. 
* **[Active recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Active_recall)**: Active recall is an act of retrieving memories with **intent**.

	* In active recall, the student would need to retrieve this information from memory. For example, by answering the question: **In which year of marriage are couples most likely to divorce?**. Active recall is needed when forming durable memories.
* **[Memory complexity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_complexity)**: Complexity of memory reflects **the structural complexity** of the neural network underlying a memory.

Cloze card is suitable for: 

* **Lists** are difficult to memorize on basic. Cloze cards separates a list into multiple cards.
* **Wikipedia articles** are a great way to provide context while quizzing you on key topics. Improves fundamentals.
