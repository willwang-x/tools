> Eliminates everything **unnecessary** during reviews giving you **maximum usable screen space** and a **clean**, **adjustable** interface that supports **touch**. [[github](https://github.com/ccz-2/No-Distractions-Full-Screen)]

## Why 

> In my experience, when you constantly see how many cards you have left, you inhibit progressing through your daily reviews. No Distractions Full Screen hides the number of outstanding cards. - [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/kg7zxl/how_no_distractions_full_screen_ndfs_addon/?%24deep_link=true&correlation_id=86fccc62-5e97-4ca8-b04f-fe0c69d55ab4&ref=email_digest&ref_campaign=email_digest&ref_source=email&%243p=e_as&%24original_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FAnki%2Fcomments%2Fkg7zxl%2Fhow_no_distractions_full_screen_ndfs_addon%2F%3F%24deep_link%3Dtrue%26correlation_id%3D86fccc62-5e97-4ca8-b04f-fe0c69d55ab4%26ref%3Demail_digest%26ref_campaign%3Demail_digest%26ref_source%3Demail&_branch_match_id=560561763420890403)
