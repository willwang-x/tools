## What 

### [Overview](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/addons)

Anki’s capabilities can be extended with add-ons. Add-ons can provide features like extra support for specific languages, extra control over scheduling, and so on.

To browse the list of available add-ons, select the Tools>Add-ons menu item, then click on Get Add-ons.

Many add-on authors include their email address in the add-on, so if you need to get in touch with the author, editing the add-on and looking at the top of the file may help.

If you have downloaded an add-on that is not working properly, or if you accidentally made a mistake when editing an add-on, you can use the “Delete” option in the menu to remove it.

To learn how to write your own add-ons, please see the add-on writing guide.
