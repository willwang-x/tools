## Why 

Minimum information principle says that **simple questions** formulated for  **active recall** in learning bring much **better** memory outcomes than complex questions even though one complex question may be equivalent to a large number of **simpler questions**.

* It's easier for you to **retain** immediately in **one** attempt.
* It allows the flashcard software to schedule cards in an **optimal** way.
