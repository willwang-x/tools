1. **Bury Card / Note**: Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review **until the next day**. This is useful if you cannot answer the card at the moment or you want to come back to it another time.
1. **Suspend Card / Note**: Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review **until they are manually unsuspended**.  This is useful if you want to avoid reviewing the note **for some time**, but don’t want to delete it.
1. **[Card Type](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual20.html#card-types)**: In order for Anki to create cards based on our notes, we need to give it a blueprint that says **which fields should be displayed on the front** or back of each card. This **blueprint** is called a card type. 
2. Card: A question and answer pair is called a card.
3. Deck: A deck is a group of cards. 
4. Note: 生成卡片的一条数据库记录，一个笔记可以生成一张或者多张卡片
* [**Note Type**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual20.html#note-types): 利用笔记生成卡片所用到的模板(Template)，类似于PowerPoint的母版
