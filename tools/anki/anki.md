> 以知识点为单位的卡片

## Why?

从大一就听说这个软件，但一直不知道好在哪里。在准备 [system-design](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)，介绍写着 

> Includes Anki flashcards.

既然那么多人推荐，那就系统了解一下这个程序员们(≈可编程)也喜欢的工具。我大概喜欢的原因：

* **核心**稳定，**扩展**繁荣: 全平台支持，高度自定义
* **问答**知识的**记忆面包**: 构建自己的`{key: val}`知识库，实现`O(1)`时间读取知识
* 缓解**压力**的**高效**学习：Let learning be More Effective, More Efficient, Less Stressful


## How?

1. Keep Your Decks **Simple**
1. First **Understand**, Then Memorize
1. Lay the **Foundations** First
1. Follow the **Minimum** Information Principle
1. **Cloze** Deletions Are Your Best Friend
1. Use **Images**, Photos, & Figures
2. Schedule a **block** of time for Anki (In test...)

Anki can be summed up with two bullets:

- **Questions & Answers**: Anki presents you with a question -- be it a fill-in-the-blank，a definition, or a standard quesiton-marked sentense —— and your job is to **recall** the correct answer.
- **Scheduling**: Based on how **difficult** or easy it was to recall the answer to the question, Anki determines the best amount of **time** to wait before asking you the same question again, thereby strengthening the **memory** at just the right moment. 

### Term 

* **block of time**: Schedule blocks of time for different modes of thinking suggested by <Your brain at work>. To recall information, meaning to bring a memory from the past back to mind, you bring an audience member up on the stage. Otherwise, it is retiring if you keep switch recalling from other modes of thinkging.(I guess)
