### Overview

Anki is a free and open-source flashcard program using spaced repetition, a technique from cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization.[5] "Anki" (暗記) is the Japanese word for "memorization".[6] The SM2 algorithm, created for SuperMemo in the late 1980s, forms the basis of the spaced repetition methods employed in the program. Anki's implementation of the algorithm has been modified to allow priorities on cards and to show flashcards in order of their urgency. The cards are presented using HTML and may include text, images, sounds, videos,[7] and LaTeX equations. The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open SQLite format.
