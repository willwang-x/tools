## FAQs

#### Q: keywords vs ?

A: 


#### Q: Will an essential oil diffuser damage my Mac?

A: So, can a humidifier damage your electronics and should it be used anywhere near them? Well, it all boils down to how high or low the atmospheric water levels are. According to the experts, it would take a very **high humidity level of about 70 – 85%** to cause any substantial damage to electronics such as computers.

And even then, the electronics would have to be exposed to the humidity for quite an extended period of time. At such staggering levels, the humidity will actually cause far more damage to **you, your family, and colleagues** than to any electrical appliances.

This is why experts recommend that you monitor the humidity levels in your home and [ensure that they remain between 40 – 60%](https://www.airreviews.co.uk/homemade-humidifiers/). This is the optimum level required to not only keep you and your family healthy but also ensure that your electronics are running efficiently. It will also guarantee that there’s no risk of mould build-up and other health risks due to poor air quality.
