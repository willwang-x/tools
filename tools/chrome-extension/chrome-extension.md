# Chrome extension 


> Extensions are small software programs that **customize the browsing experience**. They enable users to tailor Chrome **functionality** and **behavior** to individual needs or preferences. They are built on web technologies such as **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.**
> 
> Extension files are zipped into **a single `.crx` package** that the user downloads and installs. This means extensions do not depend on content from the web, unlike ordinary web apps.  -- [chrome developer](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions#:~:text=Extensions%20are%20small%20software%20programs,to%20individual%20needs%20or%20preferences.&text=Extension%20files%20are%20zipped%20into,the%20user%20downloads%20and%20installs.)
