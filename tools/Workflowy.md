## What

### Overview

WorkFlowy is a web-based outliner created by Mike Turitzin and Jesse Patel at a Y Combinator startup camp. The idea for Workflowy arose from Patelâ€™s prior work experience in project management and his frustration with the lack of useful tools.[1]

The central feature of the app is a text-based nested list. Writing in The Guardian, novelist Emma Donoghue noted that this aspect of the software allows her to capture and organise "stray idea[s]".[2]

The app operates on a freemium business model and its straightforward list-like interface has been described as "uncluttered."[3] by PC World in 2013 and "minimalistically elegant" by The Atlantic in 2016.[4] Since its launch Workflowy has developed what the Geek Wire describe as "a cult-like following." [5]
