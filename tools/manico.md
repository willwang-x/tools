> a fast app launch and switch tool designed for OS

## Why 

为了省去不必的时间：这个时间指的是要查找想要的App或者已经打开的App。

* Before: 想 -> {tab + 视觉：左右移动来选择想要打开的App} -> App
* After: 想 -> {固定的快捷键} -> App

最终选择了Manico：

* 入手快
* 简单操作 
* 其他也没有对比其他同类App，因为前两个原因，已经满足我的要求了

## How

Configuration -> Custom: 

* 识别常用App
* 在Manico中给予快捷键：option + app首字母
* 不断更新

## What

> Manico is a very easy to use app, you can learn how to use it without any configuration and study. Just remember, when you want to switch to an app, hold the **Option** key and press the **target** number, you will be switched to the target app immediately. If this app hasn't launched yet, Manico will also launch it.

In our daily computer life, we all have some app which will be used very frequently, like Finder, Safari (or other web browser) or Terminal. Switch and use them should be **direct**, the traditional way of CMD+Tab should only be used when switch to **the not common used apps.**
