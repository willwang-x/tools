## Why 

The best monitors for programming and coding should be large, high-resolution, and have features that allow for effective multitasking. 

对于**高频**使用，**健康**相关以提高**效率**的Computer Monitor，自己的需求是： 

* **舒适**：肉眼无不适感，因为**长期**不适感会导致眼睛**疲劳**， 不利于**可持续性**的健康和效率。
	* 自己使用了Retina display(**227 PPI**) since **2012**. 更难回到长期使用低PPI屏幕。
	* 指标：PPI > 200? e.g. [LG UltraFine 4K Display](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMUA2VC/A/lg-ultrafine-4k-display)
* **美观**：每日使用，必须赏心悦目。

## What 

### overview

A computer monitor is an output device that **displays information in pictorial form**. A monitor usually comprises the visual **display**, **circuitry**, **casing**, and **power supply**. 

The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting. Older monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT). Monitors are connected to the computer via VGA, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals.

### measurements of performance 
	
The performance of a monitor is measured by the following parameters:

* ...

Four main part:

* **Size**: On 2D displays, such as computer monitors and TVs, the display size (or viewable image size or VIS) is the **physical size of the area** where pictures and videos are displayed.
* **Aspect ratio**: The aspect ratio of a display device is the proportional relationship between the width and the height of the display. It is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (x:y). Common aspect ratios for displays, past and present, include 5:4, 4:3, 16:10 and 16:9.
* **Resolution**: The display resolution or display modes of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is **the number of distinct pixels in each dimension** that can be displayed. It is usually quoted as width × height, with the units in pixels: for example, 1024 × 768 means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as "ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight" or "ten twenty-four by seven six eight".
* **[Gamut](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gamut)**: In color reproduction, including computer graphics and photography, the gamut, or color gamut /ˈɡæmət/, is a **certain complete subset of colors**.

## FAQs

#### Q: PPI for some computer monitor?

A: 

| computer monitor🖥 | size(inch) | resolution | ppi | Aspect ratio |
| :-------- | :---------: | :----------: | :---------: |:---------: |
|MacBook Pro| 13 | 2560 x 1600 | **227** | |
|[Dell SE2719H](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-backlit-Monitor-SE2719H-1080p/dp/B07KW6HFD1)| 27 | 1920 × 1080 | 81 | |
|| 27 | 3840 × 2160 | 163 | |

Humans can see a maximum of **300 ppi** (60% less) from a distance of **2.5 ft** (76.2cm VS 70cm =  my desk width).

#### Q: 为什么显示器的分辨率不用PPI或PPR来表述，而用1080p/1.92K这样来表述？

A: 分辨率更加直观，几乎就可以直接知道显示一帧需要多少数据，所以也可以用在视频文件上。

#### Q: How much is the maximum PPI pixel per inch a human eye can see?

A: Humans can see a maximum of **300 ppi** (60% less) from a distance of **2.5 ft**. Beyond a distance of 3 to 4 feet from the display, the human eye cannot see the individual pixels. That is why a 24” television with a low pixel density from 6 feet away may look as good as a much higher pixel density 7” display viewed from 2 ft.

#### Q: How to choose a monitor Size & Pixel Density?

A: First estimate how far you will place the monitor from you. A body-rig Operator may
place the monitor as far as** 3 ft** away, while a Focus Puller may be only **1 ft** away. You will find on the next page a chart to help select a monitor that works well with **your viewing distance** (all other parameters equal). A distance of 0 ft means that the monitor is
not usable with the parameters entered.
