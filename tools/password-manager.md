## Why 

We are terrible at passwords. We 

* **suck** at creating them (the top two most popular remain “123456” and “password”), we 
* **share** them way too freely, and we 
* **forget** them all the time. 

Indeed, the very thing that can ensure our online security has become our biggest obstacle to it. This is what makes a good password manager essential.

## What 

### Overview

A password manager is a computer program that allows users to **store**, **generate**, and **manage** their personal passwords for online services.

A password manager assists in generating and retrieving complex passwords, potentially storing such passwords in an encrypted database or calculating them on demand.

Types of password managers include:

* locally installed software applications
* online services accessed through website portals
* locally accessed hardware devices that serve as keys

Depending on the type of password manager used and on the functionality offered by its developers, the encrypted database is either stored locally on the user's device or stored remotely through an online file-hosting service. Password managers typically require a user to generate and remember one "master" password to unlock and access any information stored in their databases. Many password manager applications offer additional capabilities that enhance both **convenience** and **security** such as storage of credit card and frequent flyer information and autofill functionality.
