* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/): **Spacemacs** philosophy (keybindings, default configuration, etc.) is a little bit different from GNU Emacs, but it’s an Emacs, only more **user-friendly**. I would suggest trying Spacemacs first, just as I’d recommend trying **Ubuntu** first to a person that is new to Linux.
