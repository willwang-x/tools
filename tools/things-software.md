## Why 

Omnifocus(2013-2020)对我来说有点重，感觉Thing更轻巧，有minimalism的感觉。所以转过来尝试以一下。

我对[GTD](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Getting_Things_Done)工具的要求：

* **收集**：在任何地方都可以快速收集想法。
* **安排**：快速提醒我当天的事情。
* **排序**：{事情s} -> 排序算法 -> {有序} （目前好像还没有这样的功能，因为需要你定义排序算法，每个人对于事情的优先级都不一样

### Section

There’s too much for you to get done in one day, but that’s no reason to stress. If you organize your to-dos with this fact in mind, you can make it easier to concentrate on doing what’s important right now.

* **Today** is the list for to-dos that you want to start before the day ends. They’re your priorities.
* **Upcoming** is for planning ahead: it’s a timeline of your to-dos, organized by when you’ll start them, when they have deadlines, or when they’ll repeat next.
* **Anytime** is home for all of the to-dos you could start at any time. It’s a good place to look when putting together your Today list or planning your week in Upcoming.
* **Someday** is the place for to-dos that you might like to get to, but you’re not sure when. Regularly review what you’ve added here to decide if it’s time to act.

To learn how to assign your to-dos quickly to any of these lists, check out these [tips](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803579/) here as well.
