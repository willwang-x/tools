## What

### Overview

AirPods Pro are wireless Bluetooth earbuds created by Apple, initially released on October 30, 2019. They are Apple's higher-end wireless earbuds, sold alongside AirPods.

AirPods Pro use the same H1 chip found in second generation AirPods, but add **active noise cancellation**, **transparency mode**, automated **frequency profile** setting, IPX4 water resistance, a charging case with wireless charging, and interchangeable silicone tips.


### Features

* **Noise Control**:
	* **Noise Cancellation**: blocks **virtually** all **background noise** so you can **fully** hear the audio from your AirPods Pro. This might be a good mode for a **gym** or other environment with **loud** noises around you.
	* **Transparency**: reduces **background noises** so you can still hear **them** while listening through the AirPods Pro. This would be a good choice in a public place where you want to clearly hear your audio but still be **receptive** to sounds around you.
* [Spatial Audio](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775): Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking brings a theater-like surround-sound experience to the movie or video you're watching, so that it seems as if the sound is coming from all around you. 
* **Hearing Aid**: Now place your phone next to the person or audio source that you want to hear more clearly or loudly, and the sound will be amplified.
