A: 

#### Q: What does TIME say?

A: This subscription-based VR fitness app takes your workout beyond—way beyond—your four walls. Supernatural was launched in April by Within, a company specializing in immersive tech. Paired with the Oculus Quest or Quest 2 VR headsets, it transports users to places like the Gálapagos Islands, or a volcano in Ethiopia, or the surface of Mars. With the help of a virtual trainer, you strike down targets with your arms and squat your body into triangles on the screen, working up a fierce, but fun, sweat. “I don’t know anyone who runs on a treadmill for entertainment,” says Within co-founder and CEO Chris Milk. “We want you to feel a sense of awe.” A Supernatural subscription costs $19 per month or $179 per year. —Sean Gregory

#### Q: Tips?

[A](https://i.imgur.com/LdaUJzj.png): 

1. **Choose the right spot**:  Push that coffee table to the side and open up some space. We recommend 8ft by 8ft for the best experience. Avoid direct sunlight and reflections, and make sure you’ve got a healthy Wi-Fi signal.
2. **Recenter yourself**: Any time you put on your headset, we recommend recentering. Stand in the best spot and hold down the flat Oculus button on your right controller for three seconds.
3. **Try out a Low intensity workout**: They are marked with a green L on the top left of workout tiles. Make sure to take it easy and let yourself get into a flow as you move.
4. **Explore the library**: Check out different genres, find the coach that suits your style, and fill your rest days with a meditation or stretch!
