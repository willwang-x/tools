#### Q: Thunderbolt 2 vs Thunderbolt 3?

A: Thunderbolt is the newest and the fastest input/output connection around, with Thunderbolt 2 and 3 being the latest in the Thunderbolt iterations with more bandwidths and better performance than the original Thunderbolt. While the Thunderbolt 2 allows for a maximum throughput of **20 gigabits per second**, Thunderbolt 3 is the fastest port available on a computer today which doubles the bandwidth to **40 Gbps**. While both supports channel aggregation, Thunderbolt 2 provides two bi-directional **10 Gbps channels**, whereas Thunderbolt 3 provides two bi-directional **20 Gbps channels**, providing a total of 40 Gbps outbound and 40 Gbps inbound.

Thunderbolt 2 port provide very **low power** to any connected device as compared to thunderbolt 3 port.	Whereas thunderbolt 3 port can provides maximum **100 W power to any connected device**. [[geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-thunderbolt-2-and-thunderbolt-3/)]
