### overview

1080p (1920×1080 **pixels**; also known as Full HD or FHD, and BT.709) is a set of **HDTV high-definition video** modes characterized by 1,920 pixels displayed across the screen horizontally and 1,080 pixels down the screen vertically; the p stands for **progressive scan**, i.e. non-interlaced. The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a resolution of 2.1 megapixels. It is often marketed as Full HD or FHD, to contrast 1080p with 720p resolution screens. Although 1080p is sometimes informally referred to as 2K, these terms reflect two distinct technical standards, with differences including resolution and aspect ratio.

## FAQs

#### Q: 1080p vs 2K?

A: Occasionally, 1080p (Full HD or FHD) has been included into the 2K resolution definition. Although 1920x1080 could be considered as having a horizontal resolution of approximately 2,000 pixels, most media, including web content and books on video production, cinema references and definitions, define 1080p and 2K resolutions as separate definitions and not the same.

Although 1080p has the same vertical resolution as DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution below the range of 2K resolution formats.

According to official reference material, DCI and industry standards **do not officially recognize 1080p as a 2K** resolution in literature concerning 2K and 4K resolution.

#### Q: Progressive scan vs interlaced video?

A: Progressive scanning (alternatively referred to as noninterlaced scanning) is a format of displaying, storing, or transmitting moving images in which all the lines of each frame are **drawn in sequence**. This is in contrast to interlaced video used in traditional analog television systems where only **the odd lines**, then **the even lines** of each frame (each image called a video field) are drawn alternately, so that only half the number of actual image frames are used to produce video.
