> USB-C (formally known as USB Type-C) is a 24-pin **USB** connector **system** with a rotationally symmetrical **connector**. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/USB-C)]

## Why 

USB Type-C, which is just starting to show up in consumer devices, has some cool new features that you won’t find in older USB connectors.

* It’s **small**. The new port is half the width and one-third the height of a standard USB connector and only slightly larger than Apple’s **Lightning** or the micro-USB connectors.
* It’s reversible. Unlike older USB cable, it doesn’t matter which side is up with a Type-C plug; you can insert it either way.
* It’s **fast**. Type-C ports can transfer data using the zippy speeds of the latest version of the USB protocol — up to 10 gigabits per second.
* It’s **powerful**. The new connector can provide up to 100 watts of power, enough to power a laptop.
* It’s **flexible**. Via adapters, users will be able to connect older devices to Type-C ports, even devices that use non-USB technologies, like DisplayPort, VGA and Ethernet.

## What 

### Overview

USB-C (formally known as USB Type-C) is a 24-pin **USB** connector **system** with a rotationally symmetrical **connector**.

The USB Type-C Specification 1.0 was published by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and was finalized in August 2014.[3] It was developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification. In July 2016, it was adopted by the IEC as "IEC 62680-1-3".[4]

A device with a Type-C connector does not necessarily implement USB, USB Power Delivery, or any Alternate Mode: the Type-C connector is common to several technologies while mandating only a few of them.[5][6]

USB 3.2, released in September 2017, replaces the USB 3.1 standard. It preserves existing USB 3.1 SuperSpeed and SuperSpeed+ data modes and introduces two new SuperSpeed+ transfer modes over the USB-C connector using two-lane operation, with data rates of 10 and 20 Gbit/s (1 and ~2.4 GB/s).

USB4, released in 2019, is the first USB transfer protocol standard that is only available via USB-C.

## FAQs

#### Q: Thunderbolt 3 Vs. USB-C?

A: No matter how tech savvy you are, there is one thing that makes everyone scratch their head...the difference between Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C. Thunderbolt has evolved over the years (Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt 2, and Thunderbolt 3). The newest version- Thunderbolt 3- has now integrated USB-C in order to provide consumers with a **universal port**, making Thunderbolt 3 the internal capability and USB-C the shape of the port . Because of this upgrade, many are confused about the difference between the two. Let's take a look at the **capabilities** each in order to grasp a clear understanding of the differences between the two.
