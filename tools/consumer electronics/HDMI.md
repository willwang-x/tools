> HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a **proprietary** audio/video interface for transmitting **uncompressed** video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an **HDMI-compliant source device**, such as a display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HDMI)]

## Why 

It's a technology standard that's designed to transmit high-definition audio and video signals. It's also a pretty big deal. First of all, HDMI is the best possible way to transmit those signals. This technology can deliver a pure, uncompressed digital signal with crystal-clear images and multi-channel audio.Nov 2, 2018

## FAQs

#### Q: Thunderbolt vs. HDMI?

A: HDMI is the universal standard for connecting high-definition video devices which stands for High Definition Multimedia Interface and it’s everywhere. In fact, HDMI dominates the consumer electronics ecosystem. You can find HDMI ports almost everywhere from HDTVs and set-top boxes to Blu-ray players and video game consoles to digital cameras and camcorders. But there are other digital A/V standards such as the Thunderbolt technology which represents the latest in peripheral connectivity and it supports both the standards PCI Express and Mini DisplayPort on a single cable. Thunderbolt is relatively a new technology which was initially limited to Apple devices but with Thunderbolt 3, it expands its support to other PCs.

#### Q: Should You Use HDMI, DisplayPort, or USB-C for a 4K Monitor?

A: Which option you should choose ultimately depends on what you’re hoping to **achieve**, and which technologies are available to you. At the time of writing, **HDMI 2.1** is already on the market. It provides the greatest **throughput** in terms of maximum resolution, frame rate, and color depth, and is **a solid choice**.

**DisplayPort 1.4** is still preferable to HDMI 2.0 due to its **superior throughput** and **daisy-chaining abilities**. However, if you aren’t running multiple monitors, the two are fairly evenly matched.

**USB-C** ultimately depends on whether your laptop supports USB-C Alt Mode with DisplayPort, and whether the monitor delivers enough power to charge your laptop. If your laptop has both of those capabilities, USB-C is **a convenient choice**.

**Thunderbolt 3** is **the fastest connection** with the highest data throughput. For daisy-chaining two 4K monitors or connecting a 5K display, it’s pretty much **unbeatable**. You can connect other devices, too, which is neat. However, you’ll need support on both the monitor and computer side, and a pricey cable or two.
