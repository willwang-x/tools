## Why 

* 自动化检测睡眠，显示睡眠质量，来帮助提供睡眠质量，和对新的一天工作提供参考。

## How 

* Start the Breathe app session upon waking
* Act based on indicator of the day's physical and mental performance potential
	* e.g. if you want to use readiness to gauge how hard you should train, go **harder** when green, go **berserk** when blue, business **as usual** when yellow, a little **lighter** when orange, consider **a rest day** when red.
 


## What

* **Waking pulse**: your heart rate in beats per minute upon waking.  It's the **gold standard** way of capturing your resting heart rate as it is done under controlled and consistent conditions. This lets you easily identify trends. The good news is that if you wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep does this for you automatically. Generally speaking, if your heart rate is **higher than your established baseline** average then you are likely to be more **stressed**. If lower, then less stressed. Stress may come in many forms, it may be due to illness, decreased fitness, lack of recovery, mental stress, overtraining or many other factors.  
* **HRV**: It's a common misconception that a healthy heart always beats like a metronome, every beat in perfect time. In reality, this is what happens when we are more physically or mentally stressed. When we are not physically or mentally stressed, the heart tends to have a more significant beat to beat variation. From a rhythm perspective, it's a bit more like Elaine's famous dance rather than the The Temptations. 
* **Readiness**: AutoSleep's readiness rating considers waking **heart rate variability** and **waking pulse** to give insights into your **mental & physical state.** 
* **Baseline**: Readiness works by comparing your daily (acute) readings against your averaged baseline. Accuracy will be acceptable after 7 days of data capture and will improve up to 28 days.
